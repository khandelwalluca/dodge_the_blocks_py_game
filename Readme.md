This code sets up a basic Pygame window, handles user input, moves game objects, and detects collisions. The player uses the left and right arrow keys to move the rectangle and avoid the falling blocks. When a collision is detected, the game ends.

To run this code, youâ€™ll need to have Pygame installed. You can install it using pip:

pip install pygame

After installing Pygame, you can save the above code to a .py file and run it to start the game.
